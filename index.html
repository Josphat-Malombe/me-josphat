    <section id="about">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I code because electricity is cheaper than therapy.</p>
      <p>Python is my spirit animal. Java is that ex I keep running into. JavaScript is that friend who’s always late but somehow still invited.</p>
      <p>Languages spoken: English (fluent in sarcasm), Swahili (fluent in nyama choma ordering), Mandarin (barely enough to survive a kung fu movie), Kamba & Maasai (parental communication protocols).</p>

      <h2>Work Places</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Quantum Ripple</h3>
        <p><strong>Title:</strong> Senior Software Engineer / Professional Coffee Consumer</p>
        <p>I lead projects, which means I spend half my time coding and the other half explaining to people why the code is still compiling.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Equity Bank</h3>
        <p><strong>Roles:</strong> Teller, Customer Care, Accidental IT Support</p>
        <p>I handled money, customers, and occasionally printers (the scariest of all three).</p>

      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="random">
      <h2>Random Fun Facts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I once broke production with a boolean: debug=True. Legend status achieved.</li>
        <li>If I had a dollar for every bug I fixed, I’d still be broke because they never pay extra for that.</li>
        <li>I fix one bug and three more appear — pretty sure my code is a hydra.</li>
        <li>I strongly believe Git commit messages are modern poetry.</li>
        <li>Life goal: Create Super Intelligence or Magic or what they call ASI whatever.</li>
      </ul>
